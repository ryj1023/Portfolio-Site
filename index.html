			<h2 class='h1'>My Story</h2>
			<p>I am an Enterprise-level web developer with 3 years experience specializing in web and mobile app development. 
         My focus is creating scalable and sophisticated software solutions for the ever-evolving web development industry.</p>
         <h2>Languages and frameworks</h2>
         <p>The bulk of my experience in web development is focused on JavaScript frameworks, predominantly React and Vue. For design and layout, I work both with raw HTML/CSS as well as with frameworks like Bootstap and Foundation.
            Although most of my professional experience focuses on the client-side, I have experience in integrating with servers using Node.js (Express) as well as  NoSQL (MongoDB) and SQL (Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL) database interaction.
         I have extensive experience with both REST API and GraphQL data-fetching practices. A few other languages and frameworks I've worked with are PHP, C, C++, Java, and Angular.</p>
         <h2>Why Choose Me?</h2>
         <p>What sets me apart from other developers in my industry is my passion for doing what I do the right way by adhering to best practices, test-driven development, good documentation, version control, and easy to read code.
            I have worked alone as a freelancer as well as participated on teams with as many as 5 other developers in an agile/scrum environment. I have implemented sites from scratch, as well as upgraded legacy software. I am always eager to learn and constantly making myself and my code better by expanding and applying my knowledge
            each and every day. Some particular advantages I have over other developers are my communication skills and willingness to teach while I continue to learn. I have solidified good programming practice not only through professional projects and employment, but through mentorship as well. I have had the pleasure of teaching some of what I've learned by becoming a mentor at an immersive
            online programming boot camp called <a target='_blank' href='https://thinkful.com'>Thinkful</a>. I believe effective communication is key to a quality product completed in a timely manner, no matter what the industry is.
