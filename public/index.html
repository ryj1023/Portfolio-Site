                This app is for anyone that's really into music (isn't everybody
                anyway?). Finally a place where the someone can find new sounds
                based on artists and bands they listen to, and also get tickets
                for any upcoming shows in their area. Think Spotify, YouTube,
                and stubhub all in one.

                This fitness assessment is a perfect platform for users all over
                the fitness spectrum. It is made to obtain information about the
                user by asking a series of questions about weight, height,
                goals, and current fitness activity. It then takes this
                information, displays a reccommended daily nutrient intake,
                allows a food search which returns nutrient information, and
                selects custom workout regimens for the user.

                traveler interested in planning a trip and would like to know
